# Stanford-Heart-Transplants
Initial Keplan Meier survival analysis of patients in 60's/70's who had heart surgery to try and determine factors that might increase/reduce survival rates. Used COX regression analysis techniques.
The main messages were that those who had had previous heart surgery were more likely than those who hadn't had heart surgery previously as well as those who had heart transplants were surviving significantly longer than those who hadn't.
