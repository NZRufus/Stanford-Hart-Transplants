# Stanford-Heart-Transplants
## Data Sources##

Data was obtained from https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/survival/html/heart.html and cleaned using Pandas/Numpy.

## Aims and Objectives and Methods##

Initial Keplan Meier survival analysis of patients in 60's/70's who had heart surgery to try and determine factors that might increase/reduce survival rates. Used COX regression analysis techniques.

## Results ##
The main messages were that those who had had previous heart surgery were more likely than those who hadn't had heart surgery previously as well as those who had heart transplants were surviving significantly longer than those who hadn't.

## Acknowledgements ##

Thanks to the open source R directory that provided the data as well as to Udacity data analytics course and Datacamp for teaching/advising on how to perform survival analysis such as Keplan- Meier.
